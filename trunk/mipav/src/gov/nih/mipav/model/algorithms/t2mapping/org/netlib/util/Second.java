/**
 * Implementation of Fortran SECOND intrinsic function.
 * <p>
 * This file is part of the Fortran-to-Java (f2j) system,
 * developed at the University of Tennessee.
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Fortran 77 SECOND intrinsic.
 * SECOND is supposed to provide the CPU time for the
 * process since the start of execution.  Currently,
 * Java doesn't have a similar method, so we use this
 * cheesy simulation:  <br>
 * <ul>
 *   <li> f2j inserts a call at the beginning of the program
 *         to record the start time.
 *   <li> on the first call, record the current time.
 *   <li> on subsequent calls, return the difference 
 *         between the current call time and the starting
 *         time.
 * </ul>
 * Essentially, this version of etime returns the
 * wall-clock time elapsed since the beginning of 
 * execution.
 * <p>
