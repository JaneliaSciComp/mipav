     *                                      <p>The ModelTriangleMeshCurveSegments constructor takes a ModelTriangleMesh,
     *                                      a list of Curves, and the point samples for those curves and produces a
     *                                      collection of sub-meshes smaller than the original mesh. The sub-meshes are
     *                                      constructed such that when the viewpoint is inside one of the sub-meshes
     *                                      only the triangles in that sum-mesh are visible. Allowing the program to
     *                                      send a smaller number of triangles through the graphics piplines will
     *                                      increase performance for large triangle meshes.</p>
     *
     *                                      <p>The Algorthim involves three steps:</p>
     *
     *                                      <p>1). First each curve is divided into segments based on curvature and the
     *                                      length of the segments. Breaking the curves at places of high curvature is a
     *                                      heuristic that works because the TriangleMesh is assumed to be a tube, for
     *                                      example the colon or brachia in the lung. If the tube bends, then triangles
     *                                      on the far side of the curve are not visible.</p>
     *
     *                                      <p>2). Second the radial distance from the curve through the TriangleMesh
     *                                      tube is calculated for each position on the curve. This distance is used to
     *                                      determine the maximum width of the tube for each position on the FlyPath
     *                                      curve.</p>
     *
     *                                      <p>3). Third, the triangles are distributed into sub-meshes. Each sub-mesh
     *                                      represents the visible triangles along each of the curve segments. Because
     *                                      triangles associated with the adjacent curve segments are visible at the
     *                                      start and end of each curve segment, each sub-mesh contains the triangles
     *                                      for the previous curve segment, the current curve segment, and the next
     *                                      curve segment. If a branch occurs in the current curve segment, the
     *                                      triangles associated with the first segment on that branch curve are also
     *                                      included in the sub-mesh.</p>
