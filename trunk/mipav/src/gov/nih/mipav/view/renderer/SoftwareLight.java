/**
 * The base class for lights in a general lighting system to calculate colors
 * at a point in space.  Each point has a position, a normal vector, and
 * material attributes that specify various colors, shininess, and an alpha
 * value to support blending of colors.  Each light has three colors:  an
 * ambient color, a diffuse color, and a specular color.  For now, only the
 * derived class MjAmbientLight affects the ambient lighting.  Classes
 * MjDirectionalLight, MjPointLight, and MjSpotLight make no contribution to
 * ambient light, only to diffuse and specular light.  This can change if need
 * be.  A light has an intensity.  Although the intensity is intended to be in
 * [0,1], it can be made larger to provide oversaturation.  Each light also
 * has a Boolean variable indicating if the light is on or off.  The derived
 * light classes include ambient, direction, point, and spot lights.  The
 * point and spot lights can have their effects attenuated with distance.  The
 * spot light can have its effect attenuated based on angle from the axis of
 * the spot cone.  The base class provides storage for the attenuation
 * factors.  Only a point or spot light should change these.
 *
 * See ShearWarpRendering.pdf for a detailed description of the lighting
 * model.
