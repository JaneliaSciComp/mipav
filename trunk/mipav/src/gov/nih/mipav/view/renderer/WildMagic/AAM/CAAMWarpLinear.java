 * Piece-wise affine warping between two shapes. This class implements a
 * piece-wise affine warping between two shapes using a Delaunay Triangulization
 * of the source shape. This triangulization is the used for both the source and
 * destination shape. The correspondance between points and triangles gives a
 * continuous deformation field inside the triangles. Since the deformation is
 * performed on a linear per-triangle basis, the field is not smooth across
 * triangles.
