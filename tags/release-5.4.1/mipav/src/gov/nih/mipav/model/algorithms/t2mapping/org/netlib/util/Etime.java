/**
 * Implementation of Fortran ETIME intrinsic.
 * <p>
 * This file is part of the Fortran-to-Java (f2j) system,
 * developed at the University of Tennessee.
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Fortran 77 ETIME intrinsic.
 * ETIME is supposed to provide the CPU time for the
 * process since the start of execution.  Currently,
 * Java doesn't have a similar method, so we use this
 * cheesy simulation: <br> 
 * <ul>
 *   <li> f2j inserts a call to Etime.etime() at the beginning 
 *       of the program.  
 *   <li> on the first call, record the current time
 *   <li> on subsequent calls, return the difference 
 *       between the time of the current call and the starting
 *       time.
 * </ul>
 * Essentially, this version of etime returns the
 * wall-clock time elapsed since the beginning of 
 * execution.
 * <p>
