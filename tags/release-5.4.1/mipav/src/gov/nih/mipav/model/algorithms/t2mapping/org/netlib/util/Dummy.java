/**
 * Placeholders for Fortran GOTO statements and labels.
 * <p>
 * This file is part of the Fortran-to-Java (f2j) system,
 * developed at the University of Tennessee.
 * <p>
 * This class aids in the translation of goto statements.
 * The code generator translates gotos and labels into calls
 * to Dummy.go_to() or Dummy.label().  These calls act as
 * 'placeholders' so that the gotos and labels can be found
 * in the class file and converted to real branch
 * instructions in the bytecode.  Thus the resulting class
 * file should contain no calls to Dummy.go_to() or Dummy.label().
 * If so, the print statements should warn the user that the
 * goto translation was not successful.
