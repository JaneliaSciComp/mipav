/**
 *  This class holds the necessary information for each "mouse event" that
 * shows up in the list.  In reality, the "mouse event" listed is a vector of
 * mouse events that begins with a mousePressed and ends with a mouseReleased.
 * In between are mouseDragged events.  In this way all events that happen on
 * the canvas are accounted for.  If we were to put every event that actually
 * happened in the list, the list would soon contain hundreds of elements.  The
 * mouseEvents vector can be empty, as is the case when a view is saved.  Then
 * just the name and the view are saved; the vector holding mouseEvents remains
 * empty.
