/**
*   This class represents a MINC dimension element.  As far as I can tell,
*   MINC dimension elements are always descriptors of the three dimensions
*   of the image file.  Thus they contain a name and a length; the name is
*   "xspace", "yspace", or "zspace", and the length is the size of that dimension.
*   So an axial image that was 256x256 and had 34 slices would have "xspace" with 
*   length 256, "yspace" with length 256, and "zspace" with length 34.  On the other
*   hand, a coronal image with the same dimensions would have "xspace" with length
*   256, "yspace" with length 34, and "zspace" with length 256.  This is because
*   MINC always refers to the patient when assigning these dimension variables.
