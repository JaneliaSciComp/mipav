This directory contains the Formatter package written by Jocelyn Paine.

This is actually a modified version of the Formatter, hacked up to work
with f2j.  Among other things, I removed some exception handling, so the
modified version may not be ideal for use in other Java code.

A quick summary of the modifications:

-added package name

-loop back to reuse format spec if more elements in vector

-support L (logical) formats

-added parsing for P formats, but no scale support

-removed some exceptions to better emulate g77

-return padded strings on READ

-allow edit descriptors to be upper or lower case
